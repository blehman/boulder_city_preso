Twitter data scientist Brian Lehman discusses the tactics and methodologies used on a daily basis by Twitter Boulder's in-house data science team. Brian will share the core strategic questions used to guide a data visualization, then enable you to make your own visualization in a live D3 workshop. Whether you are looking to answer a simple question with a basic graphic or create an advanced interactive design that is worthy of publishing in the New York Times, this workshop will get you well on your way.
